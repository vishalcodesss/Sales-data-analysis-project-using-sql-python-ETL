This is kind of my first data analytics project and here, in this project I have performed some ETL tasks using Python libraries in Jupyter Notebook 
and after that I have imported the cleaned data to sql server using sqlalchemy library in Juypter notebook and then in sql server, I performed some sql queries 
to complete the data extraction process. This is a simple data analytics project which involves the basic knowledge about the python libraries and sql queries
and its use in data analytics field.
